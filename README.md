# NvgLib

This project contains C++ code which I use in many of my projects. I decided to put such pieces of code in one place in
a form of a library. Feel free to use it wherever you want. **I don't guarantee correctness of the code and backward
compatibility.**

### Technical details

Currently everything is located in one header file, `nvg.h`, which you can simply add to a project. Everything in this
file is in `nvg::` namespace to avoid conflicts with other libraries.

##### C++ standard

You have to use C++11 (or newer) standard to compile the library.
